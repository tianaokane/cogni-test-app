# cogni-test-app 🧠💻

An interactive cognitive function testing tool built with Python.

This project simulates basic neuroscience tasks such as the Stroop Test and Reaction Time Test to gather user performance data, visualise results, and explore patterns. 
It’s part of my personal research portfolio at the intersection of Computer Science, AI, and Neuroscience.

## 🎯 Purpose

Designed as a mini research + development project to:
- Practice building cognitive assessment tools
- Explore how attention and response time can be tested digitally
- Apply basic data science to analyse user performance
- Demonstrate interdisciplinary skills for future postgraduate study (AI + Neuroscience)

---

## 🔍 Features

- Stroop Test (attention & inhibition)
- Reaction Time Test (stimulus-response speed)
- Timer + accuracy tracking
- Saves test results to `.csv` file
- Data visualisation of performance
- (Coming soon) ML model to analyse performance patterns

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Interface:** Streamlit (or Tkinter / Gradio – to be confirmed)
- **Data Tools:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib / Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Phase 2)
